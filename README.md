# An Experimental Study on the Use of Deep & Machine Learning for N.I.D Systems
In this project, I aimed to develop a machine learning model for detecting malicious intent in data packets using the "CSE-CIC-IDS2018" dataset. I conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the characteristics and patterns of the network traffic data. I then proceeded to develop and implement a machine learning model using suitable algorithms and techniques for the classification of data packets as malicious or benign. Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics, I compared it with existing approaches. My results revealed that the fine-tuned LSTM model exhibited the highest accuracy and F1 score, followed by the decision tree model. Conversely, the Na√Øve Bayes and logistic regression models demonstrated poor performance. I suggest future work focus on optimizing the decision tree model and exploring other deep learning algorithms to enhance the model's accuracy. Overall, my study offers a significant contribution to the field of network intrusion detection, potentially bolstering the security of computer networks.
